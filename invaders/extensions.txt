I have added six extensions.

1. Multiple Waves. Once the player reaches STATE_COMPLETE, he/she can choose to
continue playing the game by pressing a key. Then a new wave is created and the
game continues. If the player has previously won, the alien speed would be
1/2 of that of the previous game; if the player has previously lost, the alien
speed would stay the same as that of the previous game. I have added a new
attribute to class Wave, _alienspeed, and a new state in class Invaders,
STATE_NEWGAME, to support this extension.

2. Implement Sound Effects. There's "pew" sound when the player fires a bolt,
"pop" sound when a bolt collides with an alien, "blast" sound when a bolt
collides with the ship. There's a pattern of sounds when the alien moves. In
addition, when the player wins or loses, there are win sound and lose sound.
Moreover, when the player can press "M" to mute sounds and "U" to unmute.
Sources of sounds besides the given ones: https://freesound.org/

3. Dynamically Speed Up the Aliens. The aliens speed up as the player kills
them with a factor of SPEED_FACTOR. This extension is added in the _collision
function in wave.py.

4. Lives and Levels. The player has in total three lives in
each wave. Every time the alien bolt hits the ship, a life is lost. When the
game end and the player wins, the game moves to the next level, in which the
aliens spped up by a factor of SPEED_FACTOR2. This function is added in the
_stateNewWave function in app.py. However, if the player loses, it asks if the
player wants to try again in the same level.

(Player wins when all aliens are killed; lost when 1. all three lives of the
ship are lost, 2. any alien hits the defense line)

5. Keep Track of Score. Aliens in the bottom line worths 10 points. As the
aliens go up in every two rows, they worth two times of the points as the
previous one. For a set of aliens with 5 rows, each alien on the bottom row
worths 10 points; third row worths 20 points; and the top row worths 40 points.

6. Display of Instruction. When the program starts, it displays "Space Invader",
the name of the game. Then, it displays the basic instructions to play.
